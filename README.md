 Game for Codecademy

This is going to be a simple game where you throw attacks at a text goblin who hits you back.

I want a super simple inventory, say, three weapons and a potion.  Health, Mana, Attack, Fireball.  

If I ever come back to this, this dev branch is where I will fix the few things I don't like, such as not being able to get cancel halfway into an action selection,
and inconsistent use of .startswith as opposed to requiring full words.
