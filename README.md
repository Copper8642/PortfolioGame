 Game for Codecademy

This is going to be a simple game where you throw attacks at a text goblin who hits you back.

I want a super simple inventory, say, three weapons and a potion.  Health, Mana, Attack, Fireball. 
The silly butchering of the English language was done purely because it makes me laugh; if you come across this I apologize.
