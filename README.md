 Game for Codecademy

This is going to be a simple game where you throw attacks at a text goblin who hits you back.

I want a super simple inventory, say, three weapons and a potion.  Health, Mana, Attack, Fireball.  



Did not bother with bars:
Health and Mana will be made out of bars of ||||||| but everything else will basically be text.
